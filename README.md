# hashmap-python
Implementation of a hash map in Python.

I never studied computer science. I studied electrical engineering. We did have a semester course on data structures and algorithms, but I feel like I could do with a refresher on some of the basics.

In addition, I would like to explore different programming languages.

So this is my attempt at making a basic hash map in Python. I would like to see how it compares, both in the creative experience and performance of the same basic implementation, with other languages.
